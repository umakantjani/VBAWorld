'One of common scenario I was always fell in was where I had to work with Dynamic Column and then give the range as per the
'Column Name. Following are the codes which solved all the problem of converting Column Numbers to Column Name

Function ConvertColumnNumberToColumnName()
      Dim iMonth As Integer
      Dim CFormule As String
      Dim Mcl As String
      
      iMonth = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Master").Range("G3").Value + 24
      
      'Changing Column Number to Column Name
      
      If iMonth > 26 Then
          Mcl = Chr(Int((iMonth - 1) / 26) + 64) & Chr(Int((iMonth - 1) Mod 26) + 65)
      Else
          Mcl = Chr(iMonth + 64)
      End If
      
      lastRow = .Range("B1048576").End(xlUp).Row
      
      'Then you can use following way to assign the Converted to Column Name
      CFormule = "=(" & Mcl & "2)"
      .Range("M2").Formula = CFormule
      .Range("M" & 2).AutoFill Destination:=Range("M2:M" & lastRow)
End ConvertColumnNumberToColumnName
